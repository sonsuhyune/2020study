      "The risk of \"cancer , especially \"lymphoid neoplasias \"[desease] , is substantially elevated in \"A - T \"[desease] patients and has long been associated with chromosomal instability .\n",

      "\"[desease] In marked contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in \"A - T \"[desease] , the most frequent nucleotide changes in this \"leukaemia were missense mutations .\n",
      "These clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain , which is highly conserved in ATM - related proteins in mouse , yeast and Drosophila .\n",
      "The resulting amino - acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with ATP binding or substrate recognition .\n",
      "Two of seventeen mutated \"T - PLL \"[desease] samples had a previously reported \"A - T \"[desease] allele .\n",
      "In contrast , no mutations were detected in the p53 gene , suggesting that this \"tumour suppressor is not frequently altered in this \"leukaemia .\n",
      "Occasional missense mutations in ATM were also found in \"tumour DNA from patients with \"B - cell non - Hodgkins lymphomas \"[desease] ( \"B - NHL \"[desease] ) and a \"B - NHL \"[desease] cell line .\n",
      "The evidence of a significant proportion of loss - of - function mutations and a complete absence of the normal copy of ATM in the majority of mutated \"tumours establishes somatic inactivation of this gene in the pathogenesis of \"sporadic T - PLL \"[desease] and suggests that ATM acts as a \"tumour suppressor .\n",

      "To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis , we have compared the resting [ Ca2 + ] i , the amplitude and shape of depolarization - induced Ca2 + transients , and the content of ATP - driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild - type and DMPK [ - / - ] knockout mice .\n",
      "In vitro - differentiated DMPK [ - / - ] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [ Ca2 + ] i than do wild - type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage - dependent l - type Ca2 + and Na + channels .\n",
      "The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K + .\n",
      "In addition , we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l - type Ca2 + channel .\n",
      "Neither the content nor the activity of Na + / K + ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + - ATPase are affected by DMPK absence .\n",

      "Thirty - nine of the mutations - including 34 small mutations , 2 large structural alterations , and hypermethylation in 3 tumors - were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood DNA .\n",
      "In 6 ( 17 % ) of the 36 patients , a mutation was detected in constitutional DNA , and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity .\n",
      "The presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment .\n",
      "In 1 patient , somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood .\n",

      "Moreover , in S phase cells , BRCA1 polypeptides are hyperphosphorylated and accumulate into discrete subnuclear foci termed O-MISC BRCA1 associates in vivo with a structurally related protein termed BARD1 .\n",
      "Here we show that the steady - state levels of BARD1 , unlike those of BRCA1 , remain relatively constant during cell cycle progression .\n",

      "Recently , an isoleucine - - > lysine polymorphism at codon 1307 ( I1307K ) of the \"APC gene has been identified in 6 % - 7 % of the Ashkenazi Jewish population .\n",
      "To assess the risk of this common \"APC allelic variant in colorectal carcinogenesis , we have analyzed a large cohort of unselected Ashkenazi Jewish subjects with \"adenomatous polyps \"[desease] and .\n",
      "or \"colorectal cancer , \"[desease] for the APC I1307K polymorphism .\n",
      "The APC I1307K allele was identified in 48 ( 10 .\n",
      "1 % ) of 476 patients .\n",
      "Compared with the frequency in two separate population control groups , the APC I1307K allele is associated with an estimated relative risk of 1 .\n",
      "5 - 1 .\n",
      "7 for \"colorectal neoplasia \"[desease] ( both P = .\n",
      "01 ) .\n",
      "Furthermore , compared with noncarriers , APC I1307K carriers had increased numbers of \"adenomas and \"colorectal cancers \"[desease] per patient ( P = .\n",
      "03 ) , as well as a younger age at diagnosis .\n",
      "We conclude that the APC I1307K variant leads to increased \"adenoma formation and directly contributes to 3 % - 4 % of all Ashkenazi Jewish \"colorectal cancer .\n",
      "\"[desease] The estimated relative risk for carriers may justify specific clinical screening for the 360 , 000 Americans expected to harbor this allele , and genetic testing in the setting of long - term - outcome studies may impact significantly on \"colorectal cancer \"[desease] prevention in this population .\n",
      "Localization of human BRCA1 and its loss in high - grade , \"non - inherited breast carcinomas .\n",
      "\"[desease] Although the link between the BRCA1 \"tumour - suppressor gene and \"hereditary breast and ovarian cancer \"[desease] is established , the role , if any , of BRCA1 in \"non - familial cancers \"[desease] is unclear .\n",
      "BRCA1 mutations are rare in \"sporadic cancers \"[desease] , but loss of BRCA1 resulting from reduced expression or incorrect subcellular localization is postulated to be important in \"non - familial breast and ovarian cancers .\n",
      "\"[desease] Epigenetic loss , however , has not received general acceptance due to controversy regarding the subcellular localization of BRCA1 proteins , reports of which have ranged from exclusively nuclear , to conditionally nuclear , to the ER / golgi , to cytoplasmic invaginations into the nucleus .\n",
      "In an attempt to resolve this issue , we have comprehensively characterized 19 anti - BRCA1 antibodies .\n",
      "These reagents detect a 220 - kD protein localized in discrete nuclear foci in all epithelial cell lines , including those derived from \"breast malignancies .\n",
      "\"[desease] Immunohistochemical staining of human breast specimens also revealed BRCA1 nuclear foci in benign breast , \"invasive lobular cancers \"[desease] and \"low - grade ductal carcinomas .\n",
      "\"[desease] Conversely , BRCA1 expression was reduced or undetectable in the majority of high - grade , \"ductal carcinomas \"[desease] , suggesting that absence of BRCA1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of a significant percentage of \"sporadic breast cancers .\n",
